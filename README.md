# [Keyup][1] Product Videos Extension for Magento

Product Videos is an extension for adding on-line embedded videos along any product. Magento has 
critical leak of this functionality by default. Lets bind videos with products and propagate the goods  
with precision. For every product can be assigned unlimited count of videos of various providers 
such as YoutTube, Vimeo, DailyMotion and LiveLeak. Extension automatically gets thumbnails for 
videos (excepts Vimeo). Video can be placed instead of base picture in gallery.

## Usage

The extension has three configuration options globally belongs for all assigned videos and can be 
found in Configuration › Design › Product Videos.
* _Common width_ – width of embedded frame with video in pixels
* _Common height_ – height of embedded frame with video in pixels
* _Video behavior_ – emplacement of videos with options:
** Pictures and videos together, pictures first
** Pictures and videos together, movies first, base image remains as thumbnail of product
** Movies after description content
Size of the video frame must be setup in accordance with used template. Default size is ideal for 
standard BASE or RWD design scheme.

## Compatibility

This extension was tested with Magento CE 1.9, but no really version-specific code is used, so it 
should work with both newer and older (at least back till 1.7) Magento versions, and most possibly 
it will work with Magento Enterprise too.

## Licence

The code is licensed under the MIT license. We'll appreciate if you [let us know][2] that (and how) you 
use this extension.
